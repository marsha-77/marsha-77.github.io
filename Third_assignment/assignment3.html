            These are the books that I chose for my Reading Plan. My specific reading goal was to identify the characters in each of these five books by understanding the background stories related to the characters. When words or phrases in a story were difficult, I tried to find additional information through research.

            I worked to expand my perspectives. Opening the windows, and the sliding glass doors to people around the world, by reading books with different viewpoints, in various genres.
            </p>

            I really enjoyed these books. It was a fun find after a long time.
